# TensorFlow & Keras Package description-
TensorFlow NN was trained on the MNIST Dataset with Keras. The app has two trained NNs: baseline (97.4% accuracy) (FCNN) and advanced (99.5% accuracy) (CNN) models.
A script that trains a model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST data set. Then it loads external files and uses the neural network to predict what digits they are.

About Keras-
Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
